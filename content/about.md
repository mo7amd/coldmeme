# I Make Things Fast & Ship Them Faster

Senior Full-Stack Engineer in Berlin. 10 years turning messy problems into elegant solutions.

## The Quick Version

I debug production at 3 AM and make it look easy. Ship features that scale. Write code that doesn't make people cry.

**Last year:** 
- Built a smart size recommendation system that actually works - 21% fewer "this doesn't fit" returns.
- Automated deal processing so teams could stop doing spreadsheet hell and start scaling

**This year:** Building full-stack systems with Go, Python, and React. The kind that handle real users without falling over.

## You Need Me If

- Your builds take forever and you don't know why
- "It works on my machine" is becoming a meme in your standup
- You're scaling and things are breaking in creative ways
- Your team needs someone who can debug, ship, and mentor

And whatever else solves the problem. Not married to any stack.
